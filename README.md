# FAST NEWS NOW

## Stay tuned with the latest news updates

    A daily news web application where all different types of news around the world can be
    searched and filtered at a single place. This application was built with React JS.

    This is a front end application built with React JS using Newsapi.org developer api.
    I have leverage the power of React JS by creating several components and reused them.
    I have integrated the filter module to search betweeen different categories (Headlines,
    politics, Technology, Trending, Music, Movies, etc..,) and sources (CNN, BBC NEws, ESPN,
    The Hindu, etc..,). The search feature is yet to be developed.

    Since I am using a developer api, it limit my access to the api by 500 api calls per day.
    It only allow the requests form localhost. It blocks all the CORS request. So, I
    cannot host this project on heroku.

    Fell free to fork this project and add new features and designes.
